I've been working on an exciting new project that showcases my skills of development and user experience design. This project is focused on building robust CRUD operations with a seamless authentication process. Here's a breakdown of the features:

🔒 Authentication:
-Login API
-Signup API
-Forgot Password API

📊 Dashboard:
-A central hub to manage operations

👥 Customer Management:
-Add Customer using API
-Edit Customer using API
-Delete User using API

🔐 Routing and Navigation:
-Authenticated Dashboard routes
-Public routes restrict navigation to the dashboard until login
-Prevent navigation back to the login page post-login

💻 Technologies Used:
-Material UI Components
-Routing
-Bootstrap

📱 Responsive Design:
-Ensuring a smooth experience across all devices
This project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to integrate API development with responsive UI components and secure routing mechanisms. Looking forward to implementing more advanced features and further enhancing user experience.
